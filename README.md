## Vision

Shrutik (শ্রুতিক) is an open-source crowdsourcing platform designed to democratize voice technology for underrepresented languages. Named after the Bengali word meaning "listener" or "one who hears," Shrutik bridges the digital divide by enabling communities to contribute their voices and build inclusive AI systems.

## Why Shrutik?

In a world where voice technology is rapidly advancing, millions of speakers of regional and minority languages are left behind. Major voice assistants and speech recognition systems work poorly or not at all for languages like Bengali, Tamil, Urdu and hundreds of others spoken by billions of people.

**Shrutik changes this narrative by:**

- **Empowering Communities**: Enabling native speakers to contribute voice data in their own languages
- **Preserving Linguistic Diversity**: Capturing the rich variations, dialects, and accents within languages  
- **Democratizing AI**: Making voice technology accessible to underrepresented communities
- **Open Source**: Ensuring the tools and data remain community-owned and accessible
- **Educational**: Teaching communities about AI while they contribute to its development
