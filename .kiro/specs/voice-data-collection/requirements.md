# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Voice Data Collection Platform is a web-based system designed to crowdsource Bangla voice recordings and transcriptions for training Sworik AI. The platform enables contributors to record voice samples by reading provided scripts and transcribe existing audio chunks, creating a comprehensive dataset of voice-transcript pairs for machine learning model training.

## Glossary

- **Voice_Collection_Platform**: The web application system that manages voice recording and transcription workflows
- **Audio_Chunking_System**: The intelligent audio processing component that splits recordings into sentence-level segments
- **Transcription_Interface**: The web interface where users transcribe audio chunks
- **Contributor**: A user who provides voice recordings or transcriptions to the platform
- **Script_Repository**: The database of Bangla text scripts used for voice recording
- **Audio_Chunk**: A processed audio segment containing a single sentence or coherent speech unit
- **Consensus_Engine**: The system that validates transcriptions through multiple contributor inputs
- **Sworik_AI**: The target artificial intelligence system that will be trained using the collected data
- **Sworik_Developer**: An authorized user with special permissions to export training data, limited to 7-8 designated team members

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want to record my voice reading Bangla scripts of different durations, so that I can provide voice data for AI training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contributor accesses the voice recording interface, THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL display duration options of 2, 5, and 10 minutes
2. WHEN a contributor selects a duration option, THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL provide a random Bangla script matching the selected duration
3. WHILE a contributor is reading the script, THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL continuously record audio through the web browser
4. WHEN the recording session completes, THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL save the complete audio file to the database with associated metadata
5. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL store each recording with contributor identification, script reference, duration, and timestamp information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data processor, I want audio recordings to be intelligently chunked into sentence-level segments, so that transcription tasks are manageable and linguistically coherent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a voice recording is uploaded, THE Audio_Chunking_System SHALL analyze the audio for sentence boundaries using silence detection and speech patterns
2. THE Audio_Chunking_System SHALL create individual audio chunks that align with complete sentences without cutting mid-sentence
3. WHEN creating chunks, THE Audio_Chunking_System SHALL store start time, end time, and duration metadata for each segment
4. THE Audio_Chunking_System SHALL maintain the relationship between original recordings and generated chunks
5. WHEN chunking fails to identify clear boundaries, THE Audio_Chunking_System SHALL create chunks based on natural speech pauses while avoiding mid-word cuts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want to transcribe audio chunks by selecting how many sentences to work on, so that I can contribute transcription data according to my available time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contributor accesses the transcription interface, THE Transcription_Interface SHALL display options to transcribe 2, 5, 10, 15, or 20 sentences
2. WHEN a contributor selects a quantity, THE Transcription_Interface SHALL serve random untranscribed audio chunks from the database
3. WHILE transcribing, THE Transcription_Interface SHALL provide audio playback controls including play, pause, and replay functionality
4. WHEN a contributor submits a transcription, THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL store the text with chunk reference and contributor identification
5. THE Transcription_Interface SHALL allow contributors to skip difficult or unclear audio chunks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data quality manager, I want multiple transcriptions per audio chunk to ensure accuracy, so that the training data maintains high quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL allow multiple contributors to transcribe the same audio chunk
2. WHEN multiple transcriptions exist for a chunk, THE Consensus_Engine SHALL compare transcriptions to identify consensus text
3. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL flag audio chunks with significantly different transcriptions for manual review
4. WHEN transcriptions reach consensus threshold, THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL mark the chunk as validated
5. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL maintain audit trails of all transcription attempts and validation decisions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage scripts, users, and data quality, so that the platform operates efficiently and maintains data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL provide administrative interfaces for managing the Script_Repository
2. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL track contributor statistics including recordings submitted, transcriptions completed, and quality scores
3. WHEN data quality issues are detected, THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL provide tools for manual review and correction
4. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL generate reports on data collection progress, contributor activity, and quality metrics
5. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL support user role management with permissions for contributors, reviewers, and administrators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Sworik AI developer, I want to export validated voice-transcript pairs, so that I can train machine learning models with high-quality data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL provide export functionality for validated audio chunks and their consensus transcriptions
2. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL restrict data export access to users with "sworik_developer" role permissions only
3. WHEN exporting data, THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL include metadata such as speaker demographics, recording quality, and validation confidence
4. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL support multiple export formats suitable for machine learning training pipelines
5. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL maintain data lineage tracking from original recordings through chunks to final transcriptions
6. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL allow filtering exports by quality thresholds, contributor types, and validation status
7. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL log all data export activities with user identification and timestamp for audit purposes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want a responsive and intuitive web interface, so that I can easily participate in voice recording and transcription tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL provide a web-based interface accessible through modern browsers
2. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL support real-time audio recording and playback without requiring additional software installation
3. WHEN contributors access the platform, THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL provide clear instructions and progress indicators
4. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL implement responsive design supporting desktop and mobile devices
5. THE Voice_Collection_Platform SHALL provide user authentication and session management for contributor tracking
