# Getting Started with Shrutik

Welcome to Shrutik! This guide will help you set up and start using the platform in just a few minutes.

## üéØ Overview

Shrutik is a voice data collection platform that allows communities to contribute voice recordings and transcriptions in their native languages. You can either contribute data or set up your own instance of the platform.

## üöÄ Quick Setup Options

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to get Shrutik running is with Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Onuronon-lab/Shrutik.git
cd shrutik

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check if services are running
docker-compose ps
```

**Access the platform:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Option 2: Local Development

For development or customization:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Onuronon-lab/Shrutik.git
cd shrutik

# Run setup script
./scripts/setup-local.sh
